A tours booking system built with Node.js is a web application that allows users to browse and book tours online. It typically includes features such as user authentication, tour listings with details like descriptions and prices, booking management, search and filtering options, integration with payment gateways for secure transactions, and administrative tools for managing tours, bookings, and users. Built using Node.js, the system leverages its asynchronous and event-driven architecture to handle multiple user requests efficiently, making it suitable for scalable and responsive web applications.
